- **Pro Tier** ($149/month): Unlimited items, multi-location support, bulk operations

### **2. Improved Architecture**
- New `src/` folder structure for better code organization
- Tier-specific components and hooks
- Shared utilities and validation
- Feature gating based on subscription level

### **3. Enhanced Landing Page**
- Restored ROI Calculator (was accidentally removed)
- Improved tiered pricing display
- Maintained all original functionality
- Better user experience for pricing comparison
